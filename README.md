kkk# Embedded Linux Journey

This repository documents my **step-by-step learning journey** to become an
**Embedded Linux Engineer**.

The goal is not just to complete isolated projects, but to build a solid,
structured understanding of the full embedded Linux ecosystem — from
Linux fundamentals and embedded C to security, networking, and build systems.

## 🎯 Goal

My long-term goal is to work as an **Embedded Software Engineer**
with a strong focus on **Embedded Linux, ARM-based systems, and security** 
(e.g., in an industrial environment such as Merkur).

## 🧩 Project Overview

### 01 – Linux Basics
Linux fundamentals: shell, permissions, processes, and system concepts.  
[Explore this module](./01-linux-basics/README.md)

### 02 – Secure Embedded Authentication ✅
Secure authentication module written in C for embedded Linux systems:  
- no plain-text password in the binary  
- hash-based verification (djb2)  
- cross-compilation for x86 and ARM (Raspberry Pi)  
[Explore this module](./02-secure-authentication/README.md)

### 03 – Raspberry Pi Bring-up ✅
- headless OS installation  
- SSH setup  
- System update and verification
